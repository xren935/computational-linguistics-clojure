# Computational Linguistics (COMP445 at McGill University)
This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments of COMP445(Fall 2020). All questions and starter code are provided by the course instructors, so all credits go to them.
p.s. I really enjoyed the course and, if you're taking it, I hope you like it too!
